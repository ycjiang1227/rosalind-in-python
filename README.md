# Bioinformatics projects
As a complete beginner to bioinformatics, Python stood out as the most sensible language to start coding in. Here you can see my python projects and watch the progression of this little side project as the code evolves from horribly written to something hopefully a little more coherent.

Some interesting Rosalind problems that stood out to me (and where you can find my own solution to) are:
* Longest Increasing Subsequence (rosalind_lgis)
* Edit Distance Alignment (rosalind_edta)
* Speeding up Motif Finding (rosalind_kmp)

Coming from a biochemistry degree, the concept of dynamic programming seemed daunting in the beginning - the clumsiness probably shows in my solutions. Through extensive use of Youtube videos and abusing Pycharm's debug tool, I've learned to appreciate how the brevity of algorithms have transformed a previously redundant and mundane manual task.
