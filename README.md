# Bioinformatics projects
As a complete beginner to bioinformatics, Python stood out as the most sensible language to start coding in. Here you can see my python projects and watch the progression of this little side project as the code evolves from horribly written to something hopefully a little more coherent.

Many of these projects are my solutions to Rosalind problems; others (like the PCR primer generator) are my brainchild.
